About Firefox Version
--------------
- **Chat++** was originally made for Chrome, and could run only on Chrome. However, after receiving many requests about the
Firefox version, I decided to port the extension to Firefox.<br>
It was a hard work! But fortunately, Firefox is currently supporting something called [WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions),
which make life easier :D<br>
- **Chat++ for Firefox** only supports Firefox 48 or above.
- All the features in Chrome should work in Firefox as well, except for the syncing features. <br>
It means that your custom data will not be synced,
and if you use **Chat++ for Firefox** in two different computers, you must do config by your self.
- **Chat++ for Firefox** is still in **BETA**. Please notify me if you have any troubles.
